## About Storybreak

Storybreak is a webapp for writers to draft and write their stories all in one place. It offers two clean, distraction-free views to help writers focus on their work: one view where they can see, edit, and read their entire story, and one view where each scene of the story is represented by an index card. Writers can add, move, or delete entire scenes in either outline or story view, and have the changes reflected in the other without them having to replicate the work.
